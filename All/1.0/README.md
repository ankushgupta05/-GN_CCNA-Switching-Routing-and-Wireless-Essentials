| **Q#** | **Question Summary**                                        | **Correct Option(s)**                                                                                                         | **Explanation**                                                                                                                 |
| ------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1      | Command history feature (choose two)                        | ✅ Recall previously entered commands<br>✅ Set the command history buffer size                                                 | You can recall past commands using the arrow keys and configure the buffer with `terminal history size [number]`.               |
| 2      | System LED behavior on Cisco Catalyst switches (choose two) | ✅ If the LED is blinking green, the system is operating normally<br>✅ If the LED is amber, system is not functioning properly | Blinking green = normal operation. Solid/blinking amber = system issues or POST failure.                                        |
| 3      | Ethernet cable type between two switches (no auto-MDIX)     | ✅ Crossover                                                                                                                   | A crossover cable is used to connect like devices (e.g., switch to switch) when auto-MDIX is not supported.                     |

| 7      | Boot loader prompt on a switch                              | ✅ Switch:                                                                                                                     | When accessing boot loader mode, the switch displays `Switch:` prompt.                                                          |
| 8      | Correct router bootup sequence                              | ✅ 1 - perform POST and load bootstrap<br>2 - load Cisco IOS<br>3 - load startup config or enter setup mode                    | This is the correct sequence during router boot-up.                                                                             |
| 9      | First action in switch boot sequence                        | ✅ Load a power-on self-test program                                                                                           | POST (Power-On Self-Test) is always the first step to check hardware functionality.                                             |
| 10     | Requirement for password recovery                           | ✅ Physical access to the router                                                                                               | Password recovery requires physical access to interrupt the boot sequence and modify configurations.                            |
| 11     | SSH + login local requires what?                            | ✅ username username secret secret                                                                                             | SSH uses local credentials; a `username` with a `secret` is required for authentication with `login local`.                     |
| 12     | Command to view interface status and errors                 | ✅ show interfaces                                                                                                             | `show interfaces` gives detailed stats including giants, runts, collisions—unlike `show ip interface brief` which is a summary. |
