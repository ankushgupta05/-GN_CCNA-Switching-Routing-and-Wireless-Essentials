Here are the correct answers with explanations for **2.2.4 Check Your Understanding – Switching Domains**:

---

### **Question 1:**

**Which port speed will be autonegotiated between a host with a 1 Gbps NIC connecting to a Cisco Catalyst 2960 switch with a 100 Mbps port?**

* ⭕ 10 Mbps
* ✅ **100 Mbps**
* ⭕ 1 Gbps
* ⭕ 10 Gbps

**Explanation:** Autonegotiation selects the highest common speed between both devices. The host supports 1 Gbps, but the switch port supports only 100 Mbps, so they settle at **100 Mbps**.

### **Question 2:**

**Which device separates broadcast domains?**

* ⭕ Access point
* ⭕ Hub
* ✅ **Router**
* ⭕ Switch

**Explanation:** A **router** separates broadcast domains by default. Switches separate collision domains but not broadcast domains unless VLANs are configured.

### **Question 3:**

**Which two special characteristics do LAN switches use to alleviate network congestion? (Choose two.)**

* ✅ **Fast port speeds**
* ✅ **Fast internal switching**
* ⭕ Low port densities
* ⭕ Small frame buffers

**Explanation:**

* **Fast port speeds** allow high-throughput data transfers.
* **Fast internal switching** (e.g., store-and-forward or cut-through) ensures quick frame forwarding.
* **Low port density** and **small frame buffers** would **not** help alleviate congestion—in fact, they can worsen it.
