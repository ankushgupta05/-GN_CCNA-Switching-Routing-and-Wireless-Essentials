| **1. Which two methods can be used to identify the next hop in a static route?** | - Destination interface<br>- **Next hop IP address** ✅<br>- Destination network address<br>- **Exit interface** ✅<br>- Source IP address                                                                                                                                                                                              | ✅ Next hop IP address<br>✅ Exit interface                                   | Static routes use either the **next hop IP address** or the **exit interface** (or both) to forward traffic. These specify how to reach the destination. |
| **2. Which IPv4 static route statement is true?**                                | - The destination network is identified using the network address and wildcard mask<br>- The distance keyword is used to create a fully specified static route<br>- The source network is identified using the network address and wildcard mask<br>- **Using the exit interface only is common in a point-to-point configuration** ✅ | ✅ Using the exit interface only is common in a point-to-point configuration | On point-to-point links, specifying only the **exit interface** is sufficient because there's only one device at the other end.                          |
| **3. How is the destination network in an IPv6 static route identified?**        | - **Using an IPv6 prefix and prefix length** ✅<br>- Using an IPv6 prefix and subnet mask<br>- Using an IPv6 prefix and wildcard mask<br>- Using an IPv6 prefix only                                                                                                                                                                   | ✅ Using an IPv6 prefix and prefix length                                    | IPv6 static routes are written with a **prefix and a prefix length**, such as `2001:db8::/64`, to define the destination network.                        |

| 10     | ✅ B                | It allows an alternate connection to be used when the preferred link fails. | A **floating static route** is a backup route that only becomes active when the primary (usually dynamic) route is unavailable.               |

| 12     | ✅ A                | HQ(config)# interface serial 0/1/0 → shutdown → end → show ip route         | By shutting down the primary interface, we can test if the secondary static route takes over as expected.                                     |

| 15     | ✅ A                | 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0                                                             | This is the format of a **default route** — it matches any IPv4 address. Used when no specific match exists in the routing table.             |
