| 15   | Place the switch steps in the order they occur                                            | A. Because the destination is not known, the switch forwards the frame out all ports except the port through which the frame arrived.<br>B. The switch adds the source MAC address to the MAC address table.                                                                                                                                                                                              | **Occurs first: B**<br>**Occurs second: A**                    | First, the switch learns the source MAC.

| 16   | Which characteristic describes cut-through switching?                                     | A. Only outgoing frames are checked for errors.<br>B. Frames are forwarded without any error checking.<br>C. Error-free fragments are forwarded, so switching occurs with lower latency.<br>D. Buffering is used to support different Ethernet speeds.                                                                                                                                                    | **B. Frames are forwarded without any error checking.**        | Cut-through switching forwards the frame as soon as the destination MAC is read.       |
| 17   | Which impact does adding a Layer 2 switch have on a network?                              | A. an increase in the number of dropped frames<br>B. an increase in the size of the broadcast domain<br>C. an increase in the size of the collision domain<br>D. an increase in the number of network collisions                                                                                                                                                                                          | **C. an increase in the size of the collision domain**         | Each port on a Layer 2 switch creates a separate collision domain.                     |
| 18   | Which switch characteristic helps keep traffic local and alleviates network congestion?   | A. fast internal switching<br>B. fast port speed<br>C. high port density<br>D. large frame buffers                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | **C. high port density**                                       | More ports allow segmentation and reduce congestion by keeping traffic local.          |
| 19   | What conclusion can be made based on the output of `show interfaces trunk`?               | A. The encapsulation on interface G0/1 is incorrect.<br>B. Interface G0/2 is not configured as a trunk.<br>C. The DTP mode is incorrectly set to dynamic auto on interface G0/1.<br>D. VLAN 20 has not been created.                                                                                                                                                                                      | **B. Interface G0/2 is not configured as a trunk.**            | Only G0/1 is shown as trunking, so G0/2 is likely not configured correctly.            |
| 20   | What happens to switch ports after the VLAN to which they are assigned is deleted?        | A. The ports are placed in trunk mode.<br>B. The ports are assigned to VLAN1, the default VLAN.<br>C. The ports stop communicating with the attached devices.<br>D. The ports are disabled.                                                                                                                                                                                                               | **C.

| 22   | Which two characteristics describe the native VLAN? (Choose 2)                            | A. The native VLAN provides a common identifier to both ends of a trunk.<br>B. High priority traffic, such as voice traffic, uses the native VLAN.<br>C. The native VLAN traffic will be untagged across the trunk link.<br>D. This VLAN is necessary for remote management of a switch.<br>E. Designed to carry traffic that is generated by users, this type of VLAN is also known as the default VLAN. | **A and C**                                                    | Native VLAN is untagged on trunks and must match on both ends.                         |

| 27 | Why can't VLAN 45 and VLAN 30 communicate (router-on-a-stick)?            | a) The `no shutdown` is missing on Gi0/0.30.<br>b) Gi0/0 interface is missing IP address.<br>c) Incorrect IP address on Gi0/0.30.<br>d) Wrong VLAN on Gi0/0.45.                                                                  | b) Gi0/0 interface is missing IP address.                                                          | In router-on-a-stick, the physical interface needs **no IP address**, but it **must not be shut down**. Here, it's not shut down, and the issue is **not having an IP is OK**. But more likely issue is **routing not happening** due to subinterface config or VLAN mismatch. Still, best fit: **b**. |
| 28 | Why can't PC2 (VLAN 20) talk to PC1 (VLAN 10)?                            | a) Gi0/0 is not trunk.<br>b) `no shutdown` is not on subinterfaces.<br>c) `encapsulation dot1Q 5` is wrong.<br>d) `interface Gi0/0.5` was entered incorrectly.<br>e) No IP on Gi0/0.                                             | c) encapsulation dot1Q 5 command contains the wrong VLAN.                                          | VLAN 5 is not used by PC1 or PC2; likely meant VLAN 10.
