//accuracy 50 hai so that a lot of answer is wrong






Let's analyze the scenario carefully:

* Server B IP: 192.168.10.16, MAC: 00-0B-85-7F-0A-0B
* Switch S1 IP: 192.168.11.1, MAC: 00-0B-85-D0-BB-F7
* Router R1 IP: 192.168.10.1, MAC: 00-0B-85-7F-86-B0
* PC A IP: 192.168.12.10, MAC: 00-0B-85-7F-47-00

R1 is connected to the cloud and also on the 192.168.10.0 subnet (same subnet as Server B). When R1 wants to send a packet to Server B, it needs to encapsulate the packet in a frame with the destination MAC address of Server B because they are on the same local network segment (same subnet).

If R1 does not already know Server B's MAC address, it sends an ARP request to learn it.

So the answer is:

**If the destination MAC address that corresponds to the IPv4 address is not in the ARP cache, R1 sends an ARP request.**

---

### Explanation:

* Router R1 forwards packets to hosts on its directly connected subnet by using their MAC addresses.
* R1 will resolve Server B's IP to MAC via ARP if not cached.
* It does NOT use the MAC of the switch (S1) because switches operate at Layer 2 transparently — frames are sent to the actual device MAC.
* PPP frame or leaving the field blank are incorrect in this Ethernet LAN scenario.

---

**Correct choice:**

> If the destination MAC address that corresponds to the IPv4 address is not in the ARP cache, R1 sends an ARP request.



Here’s the matching of characteristics to the routing types — **static routing** or **dynamic routing**:

| Characteristic                                                     | Routing Type        |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------- |
| typically used on stub networks                                    | **static routing**  |
| less routing overhead                                              | **static routing**  |
| new networks are added automatically to the routing table          | **dynamic routing** |
| best choice for large networks                                     | **dynamic routing** |
| not suitable for topologies where more than one router is required | **static routing**  |

---

**Explanation:**

* **Static routing:** Manually configured, no automatic updates, less overhead, best for simple or stub networks, not scalable for complex networks.
* **Dynamic routing:** Routers share information automatically, better for large, changing networks, but adds routing overhead.






Got it! Here's the same with the **correct answer marked with ✔️** for each question:

If you want, I can explain any of these in more detail!


Sure! Here's your **questions 11 to 16** with **all options**, the **correct answer marked with ✓**, and the **answer stated clearly**:

---

### Question 11

**Refer to the exhibit. What command would be used to configure a static route on R1 so that traffic from both LANs can reach the 2001\:db8:1:4::/64 remote network?**

* ⚪ ipv6 route 2001\:db8:1:4::/64 2001\:db8:1:3::1
* ⚪ ipv6 route ::/0 serial0/0/0
* ⚪ ipv6 route 2001\:db8:1::/65 2001\:db8:1:3::1
* ✅ **ipv6 route 2001\:db8:1:4::/64 2001\:db8:1:3::2**

**Answer:**
The correct command is `ipv6 route 2001:db8:1:4::/64 2001:db8:1:3::2` because the next-hop IPv6 address on R1 to reach R2’s LAN is 2001\:db8:1:3::2.

---

### Question 12

**Which type of IPv6 static route is configured in the exhibit with command: `ipv6 route 2001:0DB8::/32 2001:0DB8:3000::1`?**

* ⚪ directly attached static route
* ✅ **recursive static route**
* ⚪ fully specified static route
* ⚪ floating static route

**Answer:**
It is a **recursive static route** because the route uses a next-hop IPv6 address instead of an exit interface.

---

### Question 13

**Consider the following command: `ip route 192.168.10.0 255.255.255.0 10.10.10.2 5`. What does the `5` at the end of the command signify?**

* ✅ **administrative distance**
* ⚪ exit interface
* ⚪ metric
* ⚪ maximum number of hops to the 192.168.10.0/24 network

**Answer:**
The `5` represents the **administrative distance** of the static route.

---

### Question 14

**Consider the following command: `ip route 192.168.10.0 255.255.255.0 10.10.10.2 5`. Which route would have to go down in order for this static route to appear in the routing table?**

* ✅ **an OSPF-learned route to the 192.168.10.0/24 network**
* ⚪ an EIGRP-learned route to the 192.168.10.0/24 network
* ⚪ a static route to the 192.168.10.0/24 network
* ⚪ a default route

**Answer:**
Because this static route has an administrative distance of 5 (lower than OSPF’s default 110), the static route will only appear if the OSPF-learned route (which has a higher AD) goes down.

---

### Question 15

**Refer to the exhibit. The network engineer wants to use the primary ISP connection for all external traffic, with the backup ISP used only if the primary fails. Which set of commands accomplishes this?**

* ⚪ ip route 198.133.219.24 255.255.255.252
  ip route 64.100.210.80 255.255.255.252

* ⚪ ip route 198.133.219.24 255.255.255.252
  ip route 64.100.210.80 255.255.255.252 10

* ✅ **ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 s0/0/0**
  **ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 s0/1/0 10**

* ⚪ ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 s0/0/0
  ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 s0/1/0

**Answer:**
This set uses a static default route to the primary ISP (lowest AD) and a floating static route (higher AD 10) to the backup ISP.

---

### Question 16

**Refer to the exhibit. What will router R2 do with a packet destined for 192.168.10.129?**

* ✅ **send the packet out interface FastEthernet0/0**
* ⚪ send the packet out interface Serial0/0/1
* ⚪ drop the packet
* ⚪ send the packet out interface Serial0/0/0

**Answer:**
Since 192.168.10.129 is within 192.168.10.128/26 (connected via Serial0/0/1), but there is a static route \[1/0] via 10.0.0.6 for 192.168.10.128/26, the router forwards the packet out **FastEthernet0/0**, which connects directly to that subnet.

If you want me to continue with questions 17 to 20 in the same format, just say!


Sure! Here are the questions with the **correct answers marked**:

---

**Question 17**
What network prefix and prefix-length combination is used to create a default static route that will match any IPv6 destination?

* ⬜ ::/0
* ⬜ FFFF::/128
* ✅ ::/128
* ⬜ ::1/64

---

**Question 18**
Router A is connected to router B using an Ethernet segment. The interface of router A is labeled "Fa0/0" and ".15". The interface of router B is labeled ".1". The Ethernet segment is labeled "10.1.1.0/24". Router B is sitting at the edge of a cloud labeled "Internet". Router A is also connected to router C through a serial connection, labeled "S0/0" at both ends. Router C is also sitting on the edge of the cloud labeled "Internet".

This network has two connections to the ISP, one via router C and one via router B. The serial link between router A and router C supports EIGRP and is the primary link to the Internet. If the primary link fails, the administrator needs a floating static route that avoids recursive route lookups and any potential next-hop issues caused by the multiaccess nature of the Ethernet segment with router B. What should the administrator configure?

* ⬜ Create a fully specified static route pointing to Fa0/0 with an AD of 95.
* ⬜ Create a fully specified static route pointing to Fa0/0 with an AD of 1.
* ⬜ Create a static route pointing to 10.1.1.1 with an AD of 1.
* ✅ Create a static route pointing to 10.1.1.1 with an AD of 95.
* ⬜ Create a static route pointing to Fa0/0 with an AD of 1.

---

**Question 19**

---

**Question 20**
A ping from R1 to 10.1.1.2 is successful, but a ping from R1 to any address in the 192.168.2.0 network fails. What is the cause of this problem?

* ✅ The static route for 192.168.2.0 is incorrectly configured.
* ⬜ A default route is not configured on R1.
* ⬜ There is no gateway of last resort at R1.
* ⬜ The serial interface between the two routers is down.

---

**Question 21**
An administrator is attempting to install an IPv6 static route on router R1 to reach the network attached to router R2. After the static route command is entered, connectivity to the network is still failing. What error has been made in the static route configuration?

* ⬜ The next hop address is incorrect.
* ⬜ The network prefix is incorrect.
* ⬜ The destination network is incorrect.
* ✅ The interface is incorrect.

---

**Question 22**
How was the host route 2001\:DB8\:CAFE:4::1/128 installed in the routing table?

* ⬜ The route was automatically installed when an IP address was configured on an active interface.
* ⬜ The route was dynamically learned from another router.
* ⬜ The route was dynamically created by router R1.
* ✅ The route was manually entered by an administrator.

---

**Question 23**
The Branch Router has an OSPF neighbor relationship with the HQ router over the 198.51.0.4/30 network. The 198.51.0.8/30 network link should serve as a backup when the OSPF link goes down. The floating static route command
`ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 S0/1/1 100`
was issued on Branch and now traffic is using the backup link even when the OSPF link is up and functioning. Which change should be made to the static route command so that traffic will only use the OSPF link when it is up?

* ✅ Change the administrative distance to 120.
* ⬜ Change the administrative distance to 1.
* ⬜ Change the destination network to 198.51.0.5.
* ⬜ Add the next hop neighbor address of 198.51.0.8.
