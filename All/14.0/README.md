### Question 1

**What table does a router use to determine how to forward an IP packet?**

* ⬜ ARP table
* ⬜ MAC address table
* ⬜ Neighbor cache
* ✅ **Routing table**

**Explanation:**
Routers use the **routing table** to decide where to forward IP packets based on destination IP addresses.

---

### Question 2

**What action will a router take on a packet with a destination IP address that is on a remote network?**

* ⬜ It will forward the packet directly to the device with the destination IP address of the packet.
* ✅ **It will forward the packet to a next-hop router.**
* ⬜ It will forward the packet to an Ethernet switch.
* ⬜ It will drop the packet.

**Explanation:**
For remote networks, routers forward packets to the next-hop router toward the destination.

---

### Question 3

Routing tables can contain all these types of routes: directly connected, static, dynamic, and default.

---

### Question 4

**What is used to determine the minimum number of far-left bits that must match between the prefix in the route entry and the destination IP address?**

* ✅ **Prefix length in the routing table entry**
* ⬜ Prefix length of the destination IP address
* ⬜ The classful address of the network address

**Explanation:**
The **prefix length** (also called subnet mask length) defines how many leftmost bits must match in routing decisions.

Here are the answers for **14.2.4 Check Your Understanding - Packet Forwarding** questions 1 to 3 with all options:

---

### Question 1

**If a router needs to send an ARP Request for the destination IPv4 address of the packet, this means the packet will be forwarded:**

* ⬜ To a next-hop router
* ✅ **To the device with the destination IPv4 address of the packet**

**Explanation:**
If the router sends an ARP request for the destination IPv4 address, it means the destination is on a directly connected network, so the packet will be forwarded directly to the device.

---

### Question 2

**If a router needs to send an ARP Request for the IPv4 address in one of its route entries, this means the packet will be forwarded:**

* ✅ **To a next-hop router**
* ⬜ To the device with the destination IPv4 address of the packet

**Explanation:**
If the ARP request is for the next-hop IP address (from the route entry), the packet will be forwarded to the next-hop router, not directly to the destination.

---
Thanks for catching that! Let me correct it:

---

### Question 3

**Which packet forwarding method is used by default on Cisco routers?**

* ⬜ Process switching
* ⬜ Fast switching
* ✅ **Cisco Express Forwarding**
* ⬜ Ethernet switching

**Correct Explanation:**
Modern Cisco routers use **Cisco Express Forwarding (CEF)** as the default packet forwarding method because it is the most efficient, using a forwarding information base (FIB) and adjacency tables to speed up packet forwarding and reduce CPU load.

---

So the corrected answer for Question 3 is **Cisco Express Forwarding** (CEF).

If you want, I can help with more questions or explain why the other methods are less commonly the default!



Here are the best answers for each question with explanations:

---

### Question 1

**Which routing table principle is not correct?**

* ⬜ Every router makes its decision alone, based on the information it has in its own routing table.
* ⬜ The fact that one router has certain information in its routing table does not mean that other routers have the same information.
* ✅ **Routing information about a path from one network to another also provides routing information about the reverse, or return, path.**

**Explanation:**
Routing is usually unidirectional. Just because a router knows how to get to a network doesn't guarantee it has information on how to return via the same path. Reverse paths may differ due to asymmetric routing.

---

### Question 2

**Which route entry would be used for a packet with a destination IP address that matches an IP address of one of the router interfaces?**

* ⬜ C for Directly Connected
* ✅ **L for Local**
* ⬜ S for Static
* ⬜ Depends on the source of the route

**Explanation:**
The **Local (L)** route refers to the IP addresses assigned to the router interfaces themselves.

---

### Question 3

**What type of network is accessed by a single route and the router has only one neighbor?**

* ✅ **Stub network**
* ⬜ Directly connected network
* ⬜ Next-hop network
* ⬜ Local network

**Explanation:**
A **Stub network** is a network segment connected to only one router, so the router has only one neighbor to reach that network.

---

### Question 4

**Which two route sources have the ability to automatically discover a new best path when there is a change in the topology? (Choose two.)**

* ⬜ Static route
* ✅ **OSPF**
* ✅ **EIGRP**
* ⬜ Default route

**Explanation:**
OSPF and EIGRP are dynamic routing protocols that automatically adapt to topology changes. Static and default routes do not do this automatically.

---

### Question 5

**True or False? A default route can only be a static route.**

* ⬜ True
* ✅ **False**

**Explanation:**
Default routes can be static or learned dynamically via routing protocols.

---

### Question 6

**A network administrator configures a static route for the same destination network that was learned automatically by the router using OSPF. Which route will be installed and why?**

* ⬜ Static route because it has a lower metric
* ✅ **Static route because it has a lower administrative distance**
* ⬜ OSPF route because it has a lower metric
* ⬜ OSPF route because it has a lower administrative distance

**Explanation:**
Administrative distance is used to choose between routes learned via different methods. Static routes have an administrative distance of 1 (default), which is lower than OSPF's 110, so static route is preferred regardless of metric.

Here are the best answers for your questions about dynamic and static routing:

---

### Question 1

**Which type of routing automatically adapts to topology changes?**

* ⬜ Static routes
* ✅ **Dynamic routing protocols**
* ⬜ Both static routes and dynamic routing protocols

**Explanation:**
Dynamic routing protocols automatically adjust routes when network topology changes. Static routes require manual updates.

---

### Question 2

**What type of routing is typically used with a stub network?**

* ✅ **Static routes**
* ⬜ Dynamic routing protocol

**Explanation:**
Stub networks usually use static routes because they have a single exit point and don’t need complex routing protocols.

---

### Question 3

**What metric is used by OSPF to determine the best path?**

* ⬜ Hop count
* ✅ **Cost**
* ⬜ Bandwidth and delay
* ⬜ Decided by the network administrator

**Explanation:**
OSPF uses **cost**, which is usually calculated based on interface bandwidth.

---

### Question 4

**What term is used to describe routing over two or more paths to a destination with equal cost metrics?**

* ⬜ Equal path selection
* ⬜ Equal packet forward
* ✅ **Equal cost load balancing**
* ⬜ Equal cost routing

**Explanation:**
When multiple paths have the same cost, OSPF and other protocols use **equal cost load balancing** to distribute traffic across those paths.
