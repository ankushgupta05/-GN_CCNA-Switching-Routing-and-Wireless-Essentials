Here are the answers with explanations for **Questions 11 to 20**:

---

### Question 11

If no bridge priority is configured in PVST, which criteria is considered when electing the root bridge?

* ⬜ highest IP address
* ⬜ lowest IP address
* ✅ **lowest MAC address**
* ⬜ highest MAC address

**Explanation:**
If bridge priority is equal, the switch with the **lowest MAC address** becomes the root bridge.

---

### Question 12

* ⬜ Rapid PVST+
* ⬜ STP
* ⬜ PVST+
* ✅ **MST**

**Explanation:**
MST (Multiple Spanning Tree) supports multiple VLANs mapped to fewer spanning tree instances (up to 16).

---

### Question 13

Which port role is assigned to the switch port that has the lowest cost to reach the root bridge?

* ⬜ designated port
* ✅ **root port**
* ⬜ non-designated port
* ⬜ disabled port

**Explanation:**
The root port is the port with the lowest path cost to the root bridge on a switch.

---

### Question 14

A small company network has six interconnected Layer 2 switches. All switches use the default bridge priority. Which value can be used to configure the bridge priority of one switch to ensure it becomes the root bridge?

* ⬜ 34816
* ✅ **1**
* ⬜ 32768
* ⬜ 61440
* ⬜ 28672

**Explanation:**
Lower bridge priority values have higher priority to become root. The lowest configurable priority is 0 or 1 (typically 0, but 1 here), which guarantees root election.

---

### Question 15

What is the outcome of a Layer 2 broadcast storm?

* ⬜ ARP broadcast requests are returned to the transmitting host.
* ⬜ New traffic is discarded by the switch because it is unable to be processed.
* ⬜ Routers will take over the forwarding of frames as switches become congested.
* ✅ **CSMA/CD will cause each host to continue transmitting frames.**

**Explanation:**
Broadcast storms cause repeated frame transmissions, collisions, and network congestion; CSMA/CD struggles as collisions increase.

---

### Question 16

Which switch will be the root bridge after the election? Given all have priority 32769, MAC addresses:

* S1: 000A00032222

* S2: 000A00031111

* S4: 000A00031212

* ✅ **S2**

* ⬜ S1

* ⬜ S4

* ⬜ S3

**Explanation:**
With equal priority, the switch with the **lowest MAC address** becomes root. S2 has the lowest MAC.

---

* ⬜ It has a TTL mechanism that works at Layer 2.
* ⬜ It prevents propagation of Layer 2 broadcast frames.
* ⬜ It is used to discover information about an adjacent Cisco device.

**Explanation:**
STP is enabled by default to prevent Layer 2 loops.

---

**Explanation:**
802.1D (original STP) runs a single spanning tree for all VLANs.

---

What is a requirement to configure a trunking EtherChannel between two switches?

* ⬜ The participating interfaces must be assigned the same VLAN number on both switches.
* ✅ **The allowed range of VLANs must be the same on both switches.**
* ⬜ The participating interfaces must be on the same module on a switch.
* ⬜ The participating interfaces must be physically contiguous on a switch.

**Explanation:**
VLANs allowed on trunk links in EtherChannel must match.

---

### Question 20

SW1 and SW2 are interconnected with two cables configured as EtherChannel. SW1 is set to mode auto; SW2 is mode active. The EtherChannel fails. What change will fix this?

* ✅ **Configure SW1 EtherChannel mode to desirable.**
* ⬜ Configure SW2 EtherChannel mode to auto.

Sure! Here are questions 21 to 32 with **all options** and the **correct answers** clearly indicated, plus brief explanations:

---

### Question 21

**A network administrator has configured an EtherChannel between two switches that are connected via four trunk links. If the physical interface for one of the trunk links changes to a down state, what happens to the EtherChannel?**

* ⬜ The EtherChannel will transition to a down state.
* **✅ The EtherChannel will remain functional.**
* ⬜ Spanning Tree Protocol will recalculate the remaining trunk links.
* ⬜ Spanning Tree Protocol will transition the failed physical interface into forwarding mode.

*Explanation:* EtherChannel provides link redundancy; losing one physical link doesn't bring down the entire logical link.

---

### Question 22

**What are two advantages of using LACP? (Choose two.)**

* ⬜ LACP allows Fast Ethernet and Gigabit Ethernet interfaces to be mixed within a single EtherChannel.
* ⬜ It provides a simulated environment for testing link aggregation.
* **✅ It allows the use of multivendor devices.**
* ⬜ It eliminates the need for configuring trunk interfaces when deploying VLANs on multiple switches.
* ⬜ It decreases the amount of configuration that is needed on a switch.

*Explanation:* LACP is an open standard that supports negotiation and multivendor interoperability.

---

### Question 23

**Which statement is true regarding the use of PAgP to create EtherChannels?**
